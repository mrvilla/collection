# Api Endpoint Generation

1. Create a reference in `server/api/index.js`.
    ``` js
    import <%= bpName %> from './<%= filename %>';

    router.use('/api/<%= bpName %>', <%= bpName %>);
    ```
2. Create a folder called `<%= filename %>` in `mocks/`.
3. Create mocks in that newly created folder `mocks/<%= filename %>/`.
    - The filename is the id which you can access by url like so `/api/<%= bpName %>/my-custom-file-name`.

That's it! Have fun!!!
